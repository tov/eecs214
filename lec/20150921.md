# Introduction to EECS 214

## Whatâ€™s a data structure?

  - A scheme for organizing data to use it efficiently
      - Goals
          - Correctness (does what it promises)
          - Efficient use of resources
              - Time (for operations, e.g. update and query)
              - Space (memory)
              - Power

  - Almost always comes with algorithms
     - Algorithm = effective procedure to solve a class of problems

  - Usually implements an *abstract data type*
     - Set of operations with rules about their behavior
     - Specifies what should happen but not how
     - Examples:
        - Stack
           - Operations: push, pop, peek
           - Implementations:
               - Linked list: cons, rest, first
               - Array?
        - Set
           - Operations: empty?, member?, insert, union, intersect, size
           - Implementations:
               - Concrete: hash table
               - Layer on another ADT: finite map/dictionary
        - Finite map (a/k/a dictionary), sequence, FIFO queue, priority queue,
          graph, etc.

 - Related things that aren't really data structures
    - File/serialization/interchange formats (JSON, XML)
    - Databases (though they often use very fancy data structures)

 - Examples of concrete data structures:
    - Array
    - Linked list
    - Trees!
       - Octree (8-ary tree for 3-D stuff)
       - Self-balancing binary search trees
          - AVL trees
          - red-black trees
          - 2-3-4 trees (not really binary)
    - Hash table
