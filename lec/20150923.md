### Stealing

  - Only turn in code you wrote (or consult instructor)
      - This includes tests
  - Avoid poisoning (seeing something you shouldn’t)
  - Accessory to the crime is as culpable as the criminal
  - (Your responsibility to protect your work)

How to avoid it:

  - Start early
  - Don’t post code on Piazza
  - If you aren’t sure, ask course staff

Why not?

  - You’ll be reported to some dean,
  - You will be kicked out of this class, and
  - MOST IMPORTANTLY, you won’t learn.
