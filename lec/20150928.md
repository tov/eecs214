# Discrete math / binary trees

## First, some discrete math

### Sets

#### What is it?

  - A *unordered* collection of elements.

  - Elements can be:
      - Numbers
      - Strings or words
      - Examples of elements
      - Other sets
      - Pretty much anything you want to talk about (mathematically)
      - People
      - Colors

  - Ways to write down a set:
      - enumerate: { a, b, c, d }
          - NB: { a, b } = { b, a } = { a, a, a, b }
      - enumerate, with ellipses: { 0, 1, 2, ..., 9999 }
      - informally: { EECS 214 students }
      - property: { EECS 214 students who are left-handed }

  - Examples:
      - {}, ∅ (the empty set)
      - ℤ (the integers)
      - ℝ (the reals)
      - the set of all sets of integers

#### The fundamental question about a set: Is this thing in it?

Let S be a set.

  - x ∈ S  means  x is an element of S
      - a ∈ { a, b, c, d }
      - Ethan ∈ { EECS 214 students who are left-handed }
      - { a, b, c, d } ∋ b

  - x ∉ S  means  x is not an element of S
      - green ∉ { a, b, c, d }
      - Ethan ∉ { EECS 214 students who are right-handed }

#### Another question: is this set contained in that set?

Let S and T be sets.

  - S ⊆ T  means  S is a subset of (or equal to) T      (S ≤ T)
        iff for all x ∈ S, x ∈ T
  - S ⊂ T  means  S is strict subset of T               (S < T)
        iff S ⊆ T and S ≠ T
  - S ⊇ T  means  S is a superset of (or equal to) T    (S ≥ T)
        iff T ⊆ S
  - S ⊃ T  means  S is strict superset of T             (S > T)
        iff T ⊂ S

  - ℤ ⊆ ℝ
  - { EECS 214 students who are right handed }
        ⊆ { EECS 214 students }
  - { EECS 214 students who are right handed }
        ⊂ { EECS 214 students }
      (only if we have a left-hander)

#### Ways you can make sets

  - empty set: ∅

  - singleton set: { x }    (whatever x happens to be)

  - union: S ∪ T
      - forall x,  x ∈ S ∪ T  iff  x ∈ S or x ∈ T
      - { a, b, c, d } ∪ { c, e, g } = { a, b, c, d, e, g }

  - intersection: S ∩ T
      - forall x,  x ∈ S ∩ T  iff  x ∈ S and x ∈ T
      - { a, b, c, d } ∩ { c, e, g } = { c }

  - comprehension (set-builder notation): { x : P(x) }
      - { z : z is an even integer }
      - S ∩ T = { x : x ∈ S and x ∈ T }
      - B = { S | S ∉ S }   (OH SHIT)
          - (Bertrand Russell's paradox)
          - B ∈ B? 10/2
          - B ∉ B? 10/2
          - Neither? The balance

  - comprehension, take 2: { x ∈ S : P(x) }
     - { z ∈ Z : z is even }
     - { z ∈ Z | z is even }
     - S ∩ T = { x ∈ S : x ∈ T }

  - power set: P(S) = the set of all subsets of S
     - P({})          = { {} }                  2^0 = 1
     - P({ 1 })       = { {}, {1} }             2^1 = 2
     - P({ 1, 2 })    = { {}, {1}, {2}, {1,2} } 2^2 = 4
     - P({ 1, 2, 3 }) = { {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {3,1}, {1,2,3} }
                                                2^3 = 8
     - P({ 1, 2, 3, 4 }) = { {}, {1}, {2} ...?  2^4 = 16

     - Alternate notation: P(S) = 2^S

#### More

  - |S| is the cardinality of S
    (the number of elements of S)

  - Hypothesis: |P(S)| > |S|

  - difference: S - T  or  S \ T
      means { x ∈ S | x ∉ T }

#### Ordered pairs and Cartesian products

  - ordered pairs (*NOT SETS*):
      - (a, b)
      - (3, -4)

  - Cartesian product: S × T
      - means { (a, b) : a ∈ S, b ∈ T }
      - { 1, 2, 3 } × { a, b } = { (1, a), (1, b), (2, a),
                                   (2, b), (3, a), (3, b) }
