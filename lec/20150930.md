# Discrete math, continued / binary trees

## Sets

### Review

  - empty
  - singleton
  - union
  - intersection
  - comprehension
  - power set

### Cartesian products

  - A × B = { (a, b) : a ∈ A, b ∈ B }

## Relations

### Definition

### Relation properties

  - reflexive
  - transitive
  - symmetric
  - anti-symmetric

### Special kinds of relations

  - equivalence
  - partial order
  - total order

## Functions

### Definition

### Function properties

  - injective
  - surjective
  - bijective

## Graphs

### Definition

### Search

  - DFS
  - BFS

### Graph properties and features

  - cycles
  - connectedness and components
  - tree-ness

### Directed graphs

  - strongly connected components
  - directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)

## Binary trees

### Traversals

  - DFS:
      - in-order
      - pre-order
      - post-order

  - BFS:
      - level

### Binary tree properties

  - full (no nodes with 1 child)
  - complete (all levels are filled except last, which is filled from
    left to right)
  - sizes and depths

### Packed array representation

  - works for complete trees
