## Sets

### Review

  - a set is an unordered collection of elements
  - cardinality |A|: the size of the set A
      - for finite sets, the number of elements
      - for infinite sets, more complicated

  - membership: x ∈ A, or x ∉ A
  - improper subset: A ⊆ B  (all elements of A are elements of B)
  - proper subset: A ⊂ B  (like A ⊆ B, but A ≠ B)

  - empty set: ∅
  - singleton set: { x }
  - union: A ∪ B = all the elements of A and B
  - intersection: A ∩ B = the elements that are in both
  - comprehension: { x ∈ A : Q(x) }, e.g. { x ∈ ℤ : x is prime }
  - power set: ℘(A) = the set of all subsets of A
      - alternate notation: ℘(A) = 2^A  (|℘(A)| = 2^|A|)

### Cartesian products

  - A × B = { (x, y) : x ∈ A, y ∈ B }
      - { a, b } × { true, false } =
            { (a, true), (a, false), (b, true), (b, false) }
      - |A × B| = |A| · |B|
      - notation: A × A = A²
      - notation: A⁴ = A × A × A × A
          - let A = { H, T }
          - then A⁴ = { (H, H, H, H),
                        (H, H, H, T),
                        (H, H, T, H),
                        (H, H, T, T),
                        ... (skip 10 elements)
                        (T, T, T, H),
                        (T, T, T, T) }

      - Example:
          - Salads = { caesar, garden }
          - Entrees = { pasta, fish, chicken }
          - Desserts = { cake, icecream }
          - meal ∈ Salads × Entrees × Desserts
              - (garden, fish, icecream)

## Relations

### Definition

  - A (binary) relation between sets A and B is a subset of A × B
      - (a, b) ∈ R   means "a is related to b (by relation R)"
      - equivalent notation: a R b

  - Example:
      - Let N be the set of Northwestern students
      - Let C be the set of courses in the catalog
      - We can define a relation T that relates students to the courses
        that they're taking: T ⊆ N × C
      - We'd write:
          - (Lincoln, EECS214) ∈ T   (he's in 214)
          - (Lincoln, EECS495) ∉ T   (he isn't in 495)

  - We can have a ternary relation on A, B, and C is a subset of
    A × B × C, and so on.

### Relation properties

  - Example:
      - Let relation S = { (a, b): exists c ∈ C, (a, c) ∈ T and (b, c) ∈ T }
      - S relates students who are in a same course.

  - Reflexive: For any student a ∈ N, a S a.
  - Symmetric: For any students a, b ∈ N, if a S b then b S a
  - Not transitive: For any students a, b, c ∈ N,
    if a S b and b S c, then a S c? NO.

  - Let R ⊆ A × A
      - *reflexive* if for all x ∈ A, x R x.
      - *symmetric* if for all x, y ∈ A, if x R y then y R x.
      - *anti-symmetric* if ∀ x, y ∈ A, if x R y and y R x then x = y.
      - *transitive* if ∀ x, y, z ∈ A, if x R y and y R z then x R z.

  - S (in same course as) is reflexive and symmetric

  - Let P be the relation ancestor-of, e.g.:
      - (your mother, you)
      - (your maternal grandfather, your mother)
      - by transitivity: (your maternal grandfather, you)
      - not reflexive
      - anti-symmetric
      - transitive

### Special kinds of relations

  - ≤ ∈ ℤ × ℤ  (x ≤ y  means  x is less than or equal to y)
      - (3, 6) ∈ ≤   (equivalently: 3 ≤ 6)
      - (4, 4) ∈ ≤   (equivalently: 4 ≤ 4)
      - (9, 4) ∉ ≤   (equivalently: not 9 ≤ 4)
      - reflexive
      - anti-symmetric
      - transitive

  - a *partial order* (*poset*) is a relation that is reflexive,
    anti-symmetric, transitive. examples:
      - ⊆   (subset)
        - A ⊆ A
        - if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A then A = B
        - if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C then A ⊆ C
      - C++ subtyping

  - a *total order* is a partial order such that for all x and y,
    either x R y or (not exclusive) y R x.
      - ≤ is a total order
      - ⊆ is not total order (there are pairs of sets that are
        unrelated, e.g., { a } and { b })
      - every total order is a partial order, but not vice versa

  - Example: = (the equals relation)
      - reflexive
      - symmetric
      - transitive

  - Generalize to *equivalence relation*.
      - An equivalence relation is a relation that is reflexive,
        symmetric, and transitive.
      - If a R b (where R is an equivalence) then a "is equivalent to" b
      - Example: Let Q be the set of ratios (a, b) where a, b ∈ Z
          - (1, 2) is in some sense equivalent to (3, 6)
