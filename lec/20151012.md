## Trees, revisited

A Tree is one of:
-- A branch with a value, a left subtree, and a right subtree.
-- A leaf with a value

    algorithm TreeWalk(tree):
        -- set of nodes, each paired with its path:
        let todo = { (tree, []) }

        while todo != ∅ do:
            (node, path) <- remove an element from todo

            if node is a leaf:
                visit(node)
            else:
                visit(node)
                add (node.right, path ∘ node) to todo
                add (node.left, path ∘ node) to todo

Suppose that the set is a stack, add is push, and remove is pop (and we
add the right before the left):

  - stack: A
  - visit A, stack: C B
  - visit B, stack: C E D
  - visit D, stack: C E I H
  - visit H, stack: C E I
  - visit I, stack: C E J
  - visit J, stack: C E
  - visit E, stack: C
  - visit C, stack: G F
  - visit F, stack: G
  - visit G, stack:

    algorithm TreeWalkRec(node):
        if node is a leaf:
            visit(node)
        else:
            print('(')
            [1] visit(node)
            TreeWalkRec(node.left)
            [2] visit(node)
            TreeWalkRec(node.right)
            [3] visit(node)
            print(')')

  - Example tree: ((a + b) * (c - (d * e)))

      - [1] pre-order  => "(* (+ a b) (- c (* d e)))"
      - [2] in-order   => "((a + b) * (c - (d * e)))"
      - [3] post-order => "a b + c d e * - *"

Suppose that the set is a queue (FIFO), enqueue is push, and remove is
dequeue (and we add the left before the right):

  - queue: A
  - A, queue: B C
  - B, queue: C D E
  - C, queue: D E F G
  - D, queue: E F G H I
  - E, queue: F G H I
  - F, queue: G H I
  - G, queue: H I
  - H, queue: I
  - I, queue: J
  - J

This is a *level (order) traversal*.
